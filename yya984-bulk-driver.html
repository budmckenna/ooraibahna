                            <p> I'm betting I'm the only one that has this issue with UPS but here goes. When my business ships out orders that would take up our standard driver's entire truck, he sends in a request to his local dispatch that the product be on pallets for their bulk driver to pickup. I take issue with this as pallets and labor to palletize costs $ and UPS is obligated to pickup packages and not LTL freight from me. The bulk driver won't load by hand so I have went up and down the roll of people Fuck George Hawaiian Woodrose Bush! Again.Fuck the bloated cadaver of George Herbert Waka Flocka Flame Bush!!! I've got three things in the mail that were supposed to be delivered today. A book, my favorite magazine--the only one I'm subscribed to that only has 6 issues a year. and of course my favorite RCs. I ordered double my normal order because I got two different ones. I even fucked up amended the order (ordered twice) and the vendor packed it together and since I paid double shippi.

I wish knew more about computers. Hi /r/legaladvice, As the title says, I'm inquiring on the legality of the Michigan Secretary of State selling bulk Driver/Vehicle Information to Third Party Companies. Primarily this is in regards to an opt out clause which doesn't seem to be available. More on this in a minute. Background: I work in car sales, and recently purchased a vehicle of my own. I started receive mail (Presorted Standard, Never first class) indicated that my "warranty was about to expire" and that I'd be liable I work for the Halliburton Cement department. I started as a bulk driver. Then went to the pump, learned it, now I went back to bulk. Long story short I decided I want to go back to school in one year. What jobs are there that will allow me to earn like 100k within one year? Am I being to optimistic. Their torrent was not the best and the MEGA links take some hoop jumping to make work, and the Baidu link requires the netdisk client and no one wants to install that, so here are some Google Drive links to the latest WIN2 "firmware"/recovery image. According to GPD, this "updated firmware" fixes the following things: 1. Updates the "TP" driver (I think the touchscreen driver, but people are claiming it's the same version, so I can't really confirm either way.) 1. Removes the Intel Intelligent. So I picked up a ts pc racer to replace my t300rs. When I first plugged it in it worked fine. I went into the thrustmaster firmware updater and tried to do the update that was there. During the update it seemed to get stuck on preparing. I waiting what I felt to be a proper amount of time which was probably like 10 mins. Thinking about it probably should have left it sitting for way longer. But anyway I closed the window and tried to do it again and this is when my problems started. The wheel. 
I am trying to flash stock firmware on my phone and miflash will not detect my phone. Device manager sees the DFU mode device on COM3 and I installed the bulk driver and I also tried downgrading miflash with no luck. Any help would be great. I really want to go back to using Linux has my daily, but the only thing stopping me is MiFlash. I like to flash my device a lot and sometimes I need to go back to stock if I mess up somehow. I know I can keep a Windows partition by I don't want to keep just for MiFlash. Any idea how to get it working on Ubuntu? gt Update 1 - I was able to get it working in a VM with windows 10. Just had to install the Qualcomm bulk drivers and had to make sure that the VM was sharing the right device Asking because, there's been a lot of works near where I live, as of late amp I keep seeing double earth moving trucks driving around with uncovered loads. It's lead to the roads near where I live becoming damaged over time. I am wondering if it is illegal/whether there is a government agency that I can make a complaint about Guide to Flashing Axon 7 With Project New World 8.1 Beta and rooting with Magisk I have not seen many places talking about this custom ROM so I thought I would make this guide to help everyone. This guide is assuming you are on stock firmware. It seems that ZTE has made it a little harder to unlock the bootloader after the Android Nougat update. This should help those trying to unlock the bootloader, root and flash Project New World 8.1 Beta. DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE 
Hello, I bought the Thrustmaster T150 PRO FFB, and had it working on my PC. The first time opening and setting everything up was fine, the drivers installed correctly with the wheel connecting and calibrating fine. After the restart to finish the driver install, everything was in order. The control panel showed the wheel separate from the other devices and specifically as a T150, and the device manager also showed the wheel as a T150. The firmware was fine, showing a different settings panel. I have bought the pc version and there was a mod that enabled actual driver and car names. I could also edit all the drivers and cars. So that gave me a a realistic feel. Is this possible in the mobile version - MM3 ? I also bought the DLC, but that was very limited and would take ages to change everything on mobile. Guide to Rooting Axon 7 With Android Nougat Update It seems that ZTE has made it a little harder to unlock the bootloader after the Android Nougat update. This should help those trying to unlock the bootloader, root and flash LieageOS DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BRICK YOUR DEVICE! MAKE A BACKUP OF EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU CONTINUE! THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY! Prerequisites: ADB and Fastboot Setup Exe (https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=258897. Hate to sound naive, but a buddy of mine said he has a spot open for a cementing training with big red and I have absolutely no idea what it is and couldn’t get any more info out of him yet. I do flowback now, but this would be much closer to home. So like, what is the job? Does it pay decent, is the work steady, is the rotation similar to flowback stuff. Give me the whole run down if you would be so kind. Appreciate. 
We are taking Lyft multiple times a day on a trip that took us from the East Coast to San Francisco for 5 days.I had only taken a handful of rides as a passenger previously. Most are 2-3 miles tops and I’ve been amazed to see that some rides are right around  for shared. San Fran sucks for hills if you have ever been, we were on one in our car that was a legit 45 degree angle last night. These rides are a godsend for my knees and calves. Anyway, my point is that even though we are takin. </p>
