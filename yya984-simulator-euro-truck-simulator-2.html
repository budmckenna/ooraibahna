So should I just keep playing that and buy the missing DLC, get ATS, or ED? The draw for American Truck Sim is just to have more recognizable locations. I mean, ATS over the DLC seems like a no brainer, as it's another whole game instead of more locations, but maybe the DLC has more content than ATS?

UPDATE Now the list contains already 53 reviews, added: Elite: Dangerous (no verdict with Vive so far but was great with Rift) , Babel: Tower to the Gods (great!) and the Astral Domine Demo (good!). I also moved the presenz demo(not interesting) and the Cubicle (great!) from the no verdict to their new sections after I got it working! So I was one of the lucky people that got their Vives on release day. With almost four weeks of VR and over 50 hours of playtime, I thought I'd share my recom. I have.
