                            <p> I downloaded the latest Raspbian Pixel from the Raspberry Pi web site dated 1-11-2017. The zip file cannot be unzipped using the built-in Windows unzip tool. The file does unzip properly using 7-zip. On Christmas morning, the woman wakes up her husband: "Honey, I know we said no gifts but I wanted to still celebrate Christmas with what we have." She takes out two lighters and holds them in each hand exclaiming "look, Christmas lights!" Next, she takes out a pair of keys and rattles them around - "Jingle bells!" The man, feeling the Christmas joy, goes over to the window, unzips his pants and proceeds to urinate out the open window. His wife gasps in horror and shouts "John, what on Earth. Lots of people install it reflexively, but I've honestly never seen the point. Windows since XP can create and extract ZIP files, after all, so for most use cases you literally don't need it. And when I help those people, and try to quickly unzip an archive for them, I find WinZip's context menu to be slower and more awkward than the default Windows version. With native Zip support, it's trivial to unzip "Achive.zip" to a folder called ".\Archive" -- but with Winzip, it's more effort. Yesterday you might have seen a certain thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/71bqei/factorio_vanilla_challenge_launch_a_rocket_but/?utm_content=titleamputm_medium=hotamputm_source=redditamputm_name=factorio) floating around concerning a specific challenge: launch a rocket without deconstructing anything, with some exceptions and other restrictions. I commented that if there were enough interest, and that I could try making a custom scenario out of this. One day later Beginner's guide to Myriad Mining using your Desktop PC ampnbsp; I'll try in this post to cut through the tech talk in a way ANYONE can get up and mining in a few short minutes, and have coin in their wallet ASAP. For this guide to work you need a desktop PC, and that's about it. ampnbsp; Requirements: ampnbsp; -CPU (central processing unit) (i.e. Core 2 duo, Core i7, AMD R5, AMD R7). ampnbsp; The more threads the better. If you don't understand this part, don't worry. 
I'm having nothing but issues trying to accomplish this, because windows 10 doesn't like fat32. Seems like there has to be someone who's figured this out. Edit: I've got a broken SD card. Doesn't work in any device. For people interested in playing War Thunder with their HTC Vive on Steam, I just successfully ran it on mine: -Install "Oculus home" https://www.oculus.com/en-us/setup/ (no worries you don't need a Rift) -Launch SteamVR and keep it running -Launch War Thunder Launcher, in advanced graphics settings, check "oculus rift", close the window -Unzip the content of ReviveInjector (found here https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive/releases/download/0.2.1/ReviveInjector.zip) in your Steam\SteamApps\commo. Hi, I'll start by saying I am not a Mac person, so I thought I'd reach out to some people who are much more knowledgeable than me about the matter. Long story short, our user is trying to unzip a file from the server at our work. Given his access permissions on the server end, he should be able to access it. Yet it only works if he moves the file to his desktop, otherwise the archive utility generates the permission denied error. I'm not entirely sure what to do or where to start, seems. ## Bug fixes in 1.2.3 - Fix crashing Downloader when Quota were set - Fix broken webserver HTTPS for extra bound ports (e.g. IPv6) - Windows: Fix hanging Unrar - Windows: Unzip was not working - Windows: Incomplete folders would sometimes end in a dot - Starting with "-w" parameter fail - Unblock Server button did not work ## Bug fix in 1.2.2 - Windows: job-directory incorrectly passed to PostProcessing-script ## https://sabnzbd.org/downloads. Back in the 90s I ran Color 64 and then moved to Supra 128 because I wanted to take full advantage of BASIC 7 and the 128. My 158I caught fire so that ended my BBS days. Recently I got back into it and got in touch with the current owner of the brand. He supplied me with the last stable release version, version 4.6, which I modified to work with Telnet BBS software. So now it's up! It is running pretty much stock until I can be sure the telnet routines are working. For people interested in playing War Thunder with their HTC Vive on Steam, I just successfully ran it on mine: -Launch SteamVR and keep it running -Launch War Thunder Launcher, in advanced graphics settings, check "oculus rift", close the window -Unzip the content of ReviveInjector (found here https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive/releases/download/0.2.1/ReviveInjector.zip) in your Steam\SteamApps\common\War Thunder\win64 folder -Drag Aces.exe over ReviveInjector.exe to launch the game (press. Edit: Solved. See comments. I have a late 2009 iMac that I went to reinstall the OS on, when it goes to download Yosemite from app store it says item unavailable. I tried all the work arounds and went through all the motions with Apple support and they want me to go to genius bar to reinstall Yosemite for roughly 100. Can anyone pm me how I can do this myself, I only have access to a working windows or linux setup as the iMac is stuck on osx utilities menu from 10.10.5 recovery partition. The idea of this was to save people time from doing a bunch of googling around and sorting through a bunch of outdated posts and information. I tried to write this in a way that could be understood easily and difficult to misinterpret. It's fairly short if you only read the bolded parts . The unbolded is to elaborate. This guide assumes you have access to a computer with a command prompt / terminal. This was written with Windows in mind. Looks like July's 2016 security update 
Over the course of the past few years, I have heard a lot about the so-called "Deepweb". I've always been curious about it, but never taken the time to understand it until recently. Now that I've taken the plunge, I wish I had earlier. It's easy to get started, and it truly is a unique and intriguing place. I'll outline the steps to get started: Download the Tor Browser Bundle (https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en). This package contains everything Thanks to the heads up from this forum I managed to rip the whole plugin collection before it went down the last time. Also u/itsamamaluigi great suggestion of putting them up to archive.org so that we can all keep enjoying them. There's a lot of files so it's split into a zip for each game. They are organised into category folders with a txt for each plugin that contains the info and description. https://archive.org/details/EscapeVelocityPluginCollection (https://archive.org/details/Escape. When I was 10 I saved up  and bought a skateboard, and a decade and a half later I saved up a bit more and made my second ever vehicle purchase: a '97 TJ ( obligatory picture ( Jeep life has been absolutely wonderful, but I have a few questions: It has HID headlights and fog lights, which both work fine, but the head lights are on when I think they should be off and vice versa. To clarify (where "knob" is the thingy to the left of the steering wheel Hey guys, I play EQ on a Mac (I know), and so log in using Crossover. Wondering if anyone has had any success installing Brewall's maps through Crossover, because I'm having some trouble. If so, how'd you do it? amp#x200B; Thanks. I thought there might be a few folks out there who'd like to try playing the game on their PC with a PS3 controller. The game works great using a controller, and makes couch-pc-mmoing a reality! Here is the set up using MotionJoy drivers and BetterDS3. 1) Get the Driver Go here ( and download the motionjoy driver (0.7.0000) for Windows. Unzip and install. 2) Setup Driver We're only using the drivers from MotionJoy, not the DS3 Tool that comes. Daemount still exists, but is it cool anymore ? What's the new black ? amp#x200B; edit - Thanks to u/Biduleman (https://www.reddit.com/user/Biduleman) for the steps - For reference it turns out right clickgtopen ingtexplorer is the way to get windows to do it without 3rd party. Hello, I just switched from a custom built macintosh to a Windows PC. I made sure to zip all my files before switching, but now that I try to unzip my files on Windows, it keep crashing every software I used. I used the regular right click - gt "compress" to archive files on the mac And I tested WInrar, 7zip, Winzip to unarchive the files. All of them crashed. Only 7zip gave a hint about his issue by saying "32 bits overflow in headers". Thanks I'm trying to send a password protected zip file to someone. I'm using 7zip to create the zip file with password protection, that contains a single PDF and that part works fine. The issue is that I'm unable to extract the PDF from the zip file using the native Windows 10 unzipper  How to I unzip an encrypted zip file using the native Windows 10 unzipper? (I understand that using 7zip to extract it will work but that's not an option in this case). Thanks. </p>
